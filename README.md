## Description 

`cvextend` extends the functionality offered by the Model Selection module of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), specifically aimed at better API for nested cross-validation.

`cvextend.generate_param_grid` helps with permutating models in steps and their hyperparameters in your `sklearn.pipeline`. See the example [here](https://pypkg-cvextend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/cvextend.generate_param_grid.html)

`cvextend.ScoreGrid` helps you keep track of the scores you want to use in cross-validations with different optimisation objectives in parallel. See the example [here](https://pypkg-cvextend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/cvextend.ScoreGrid.html) and also [cvextend.EvaluationGrid](https://pypkg-cvextend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/cvextend.ScoreGrid.html).
